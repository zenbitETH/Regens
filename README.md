# Eneagon

A #REGEN game to collect Bogota's public places and incentivize citizen coordination to solve public needs..

Developed at [ETH Bogota 2022](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/regens-9hxb6)  

## About
Regens is collaborative game to gamify Urban Interactions and improve citizen coordination in Bogota public places. Players will be able to take 4 quests in the city to collect public places as NFTs, generate video content related to those places and get rewards.

Collectors sharing the same Quest will be able to participate on governance interactions to identify public needs and create proposals on IRL public goods. All proposals will be shared with the Government offices dedicated to each Quest topic. Players with a worldcoin ID will be able to boost their rewards.

- A scaffold ETH + Tailwind template for the dapp  
- IPFS for the video storage
